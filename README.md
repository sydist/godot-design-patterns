# Godot Design Patterns

Recognizing design patterns and anti-patterns is an excellent way to grow as a developer. It facilitates better communication with colleagues and prevents the need to reinvent the wheel when encountering common problems.

The goal of this repository is to document common design patterns found in Godot projects, as well as those that are widely recognized elsewhere. The design patterns will be implemented in Godot's scripting language: GDScript

However, this repository does not implement patterns that are already built into Godot, such as the observer pattern.
